This repository contains the code and presentation for a research assignment completed as part of the AI in Healthcare course during my master's studies. The primary objective was to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting COVID-19 medication outcomes based on prescription data.

Title of the assignment:
LLM for COVID-19 Medication Outcome Prediction: Using GPT-4, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought & Embedding Classification

ðŸ§ª Overview
This project investigates how different prompting strategies and embeddings can be used with LLMs (like GPT-4) to predict survival outcomes for COVID-19 patients based on the medications administered. Approaches include:

- Zero-shot and few-shot prompting

- Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought reasoning

- Embedding-based classification models

ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
ðŸ““ Notebook â€“ Contains implementation of prompt engineering techniques, embedding model, and evaluation metrics

ðŸ“Š Presentation (PPTX) â€“ Summarizes methodology, key findings, and future directions

ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
Embedding classifier achieved ~0.80 AUROC, showing solid predictive performance

Prompt-based reasoning methods demonstrated interpretability and flexibility
